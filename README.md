# Police Web System

I am proudly introducing one of my first web development projects that include technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP.

## Project Overview
The idea was to create a solution for a Police station (or stations) where an Admin user can control everything (there can be multiple of them) and other users can provide feedback on incidents, report them, report their daily shifts, report new suspects, and more. New users can register but are not allowed to access the system until one of the Admin users accepts them.

## Frontend Technologies
On the frontend of the Police Web System, **jQuery** is utilized for DOM manipulation and handling AJAX calls. Following that:
- **SPApp** plugin for initialization of a single-page application and client-side routing
- **Bootstrap** for styling
- **DataTables** for server-side pagination, effective data lookup, and data sorting.

## Backend Technologies
On the backend of this Web Application, **FlightPHP** was used, further accompanied with:
- **Swagger** annotations for API documentation, which is based on the OpenAPI3 specification
- **JWT authentication**

## Course Information
All of this was a course project for **IT 207 - Introduction to Web Programming** at International Burch University. This project carries 25% of the total course grade.
